# javascript-mock-bank-frontend
My very first JavaScript front-end (made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Vuetify](https://v2.vuetifyjs.com/en/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)), made for my JavaScript course during my 6th semester at the Autonomous University of Baja California (February - May, 2021): a basic mock bank system UI. This UI will need the [back-end](https://github.com/mareyna356/javascript-mock-bank-backend/) running to be able to receive services through HTTP requests.

This UI utilizes HTTPS, so you require an SSL certificate and private key for it to execute. I utilized [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to generate my self-signed certificate and private key. The certificate and private key must be named ***certificate.crt*** and ***private.key*** respectively, and both must be present on the same level as [***server.js***](server.js). The required names for the certificate and the private key can be changed, if you so wish, in [***server.js***](server.js). In case of a "**Cross-Origin Request Blocked**" error, which will only show up in your browser's developer tool's console and prevents the front-end from interacting with the back-end, you'll have to access the back-end through your browser and manually accept the self-signed certificate.

To run the front-end, execute `npm run serve`.

## How to use

### Navigation bar
By clicking on the â‰¡ button next to "Banco" in the top-left corner of the UI, you can open up the **navigation bar**.

The navigation bar allows you to navigate to the 4 main sections of the UI and it can be used in any of those sections.

### Home
The initial page is the **Home** page. This page simply explains what each route of the back-end API does, as well as what is required in the body of each POST, PUT and PATCH request.
