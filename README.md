# javascript-mock-bank-frontend
My very first JavaScript front-end (made with Vue and Vuetify), made for my JavaScript course during my 6th semester at the Autonomous University of Baja California (February - May, 2021): a basic mock bank system UI. This UI of course will need the back-end running.
